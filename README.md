# Audio Mirror



### General
A C# console program which:

- Creates a lightweight 'mirror' of my music library.

- Analyses its metadata statistically.

- Audits my music library against criteria related to file format, metadata, and organisational structure.



### Mirror Details
- This repo contains a lightweight 'mirror' of my Audio (Music) folder, in which I keep my music library.

- This allows to me share my music library information and how it is organised without having to provide the actual audio files.

- Each audio file in my music library is mirrored by an XML file in this repo containing the track's metadata (e.g. title, artist, genre etc.)



### Statistics Provided

- Number of tracks 

- Percentage and count breakdown of:
  - Artists
  - Genres
  - Years
  - Decades
