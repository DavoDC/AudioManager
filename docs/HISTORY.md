Completed features, settled design decisions, and resolved tasks.

## 2026-04-08 - Architecture decisions settled

**Integrator stays in AudioManager** - shares Constants, LibChecker, and tag models with the rest of AudioManager. Splitting would require duplicating or packaging shared code with no real gain at this scale. Logical separation (each component has its own entry point) is sufficient.

**Audio reports stay in AudioManager** - AudioMirror is a data repo; generating/storing analysis reports there would blur its purpose. AudioManager owns the tools and the outputs.

**LibChecker output in audio report** - "Checking library..." process lines do not belong in a stats report. Rule: if LibChecker clean, show a single `LibChecker: Clean` line in the report. If issues exist, prominently flag them in the report AND block the AudioMirror commit - fix issues first, then commit both the report and AudioMirror changes.

## 2026-04-08 - LibChecker: version/edition suffix detection

Added `"version"` and `"explicit"` to `Constants.UnwantedInfo`. LibChecker now flags titles containing `(Explicit Version)`, `(Album Version)` etc. `(Radio Edit)` and `(Deluxe Edition)` were already caught by the existing `"edit"` entry.

---

## Constants.cs consolidation (already done)

`MiscDir`, `ArtistsDir`, `MusivDir`, `MotivDir` were already defined in `Constants.cs`. Both `LibChecker` and `MusicIntegrator` already read from `Constants` - no duplication existed.

---

## LibChecker owns validation (already done)

`MusicIntegrator`'s only "validation" is a routing precondition (skip files missing artist/title - can't determine destination without them). This is not duplicated LibChecker logic. The boundary was already clean.

---

## ReportWriter - plain static class (already done)

`ReportWriter` is already `internal static class`, not inheriting from Doer. Idea retired.

---

## Analyser stats (already implemented)

Total playback hours, average and median song length, total library size (GB), average file size (MB), track age stats (average, median, oldest, newest), year and decade frequency distribution. All in `Analyser.cs`.

## 2026-04-07 - Fix git folder casing

Git tracked folders in old uppercase names (`PROJECT/`, `REPORTS/`, `Docs/`) while they were lowercase on disk. Fixed via two-step `git mv` per folder (required because Windows filesystem is case-insensitive and ignores direct renames). Also updated `REPORTS` path string in `Constants.cs` and comments in `ReportWriter.cs` to match.
